- PFT specific output for biological nitrogen fixation with grid and PFT scaling in `npp_contr_biol_n_fixation.c` and `biologicalNfixation.c`.


### Changed

- Adjusted optimum temperature limits (`"temp_bnf_opt"`) of herbaceous PFTs for NPP controled biological nitrogen fixation in `pft.js`.


## [5.6.9] - 2023-05-10

### Added

- Missing `break` statement added in `harvest_stand.c`. See issue [#302](https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/lpjml/LPJmL_internal/-/issues/302)

## [5.6.8] - 2023-04-28

### Added

- flag `"start_coupling"` added in configuration file. If lpjml is coupled to an external model via
```

  this flag allows so set a year when input is received from the external model. Before that year input is read from input file.
  If flag is omitted or set to `null` coupling starts at the first year.

### Changed

- For input received from an external model a file name can additionally be specified where input is read from before the specified coupling year:
```
  "with_tillage" : { "fmt" : "clm", "socket" : true, "name" : "tillage.clm"},
```
- lpjcheck and lpjml checks for specified filenames if they are necessary for the coupled run
